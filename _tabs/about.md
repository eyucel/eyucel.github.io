Hi, I'm a Senior Machine Learning Scientist with Expedia Group where I work on pricing and revenue management and optimization, experimentation, causal inference, and predictive modeling. I'm also a lecturer at the McCombs School of Business which combines my love of statistics with my passion for teaching. Passions of mine include board games, hiking, and mountain biking (which for me is just hiking slightly faster through the woods!).
